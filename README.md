A Udacity FEND project.

This is an implementation of Frogger game where user has to go through a lane avoiding the beetles.
They score a point once they cross the lane without getting hit.
With increasing score, the number of beetles increases.


#### Running

https://tejaldudhe.github.io/Classic-Arcade-Game-Clone/ OR open `index.html` in browser (after cloning).

You will see something like the following screenshot. After that, use the arrow keys to move the character.
Your goal is to make him reach the water side (on the top) without getting hit from any of the beetles.
When the player reaches the water side, he starts again from the default position but with the score incremented.
